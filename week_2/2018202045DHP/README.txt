This is a README file to explain my second homework.

No big change in comparasion with the first week's.
(I separated my work into muti-file work as soon as last Thursday so I don't need to make big changes)

Cater to almost all the requirements of the homework.

I reeeeeaaaaally can't find any place to insert some "inline"s LOL.

Next homework I will make some changes in users private settings.
Able to change the HOST, the filter and target direction in user's private log-files without changing the source code.

And well, you can run my program by typing:

make
./IW

And all of the webs with the  : "http://info.ruc.edu.cn/" will be parsed , which stored in a file named "result.out"

I haven't run it once more. You can refer to my last week's homework.
But fewer webs will be parsed because I add some substrings like .zip, .rar, .xlsx into my filter.

That's it. My next week's homework will be changed a lot.
